# HexaSynth
## Overview

### HexaSynth is a generative music project inspired by John Cage's use of the I Ching as a compositional tool. This project explores sonification techniques to create a unique audio experience based on the hexagrams derived from the I Ching.

### Currently, the project generates hexagrams with changing lines and plays two stacks of 3-note chords based on the trigrams of the derived hexagram. Future plans include adding a more divination-based random generator, sound and frequency customization, volume control, and other features as the concept evolves.
#### Features

  Hexagram Generator: Generates hexagrams with changing lines.
  Trigram-Based Chords: Plays two stacks of 3-note chords based on the trigrams derived from the hexagram.
  Interactive GUI: A simple graphical user interface that displays the generated hexagram and allows user interaction.

#### Future Development

  Divination-Based Random Generator: Implement a more authentic random generator inspired by traditional I Ching divination methods.
  Sound and Frequency Customization: Add options to change the sounds and frequencies that play for each trigram.
  Volume Control: Introduce volume control for more dynamic soundscapes.
  Enhanced GUI: Improve the user interface with more features and better visualization.

#### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites

  - JUCE library
  - C++11 or higher
